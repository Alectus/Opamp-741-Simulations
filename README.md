# Opamp-741-Simulations

This project tries to give some more details about simulating opamp 741 with SimulIDE. 

It uses this book:

https://diagramas.diagramasde.com/otros/41%20Projects%20using%20IC%20741%20OP-AMP.pdf

A text file is added with more details about each simulation and will be updated now and then.

The simulations are made with SimulIDE 0.4.15-SR1 and can be downloaded here:

https://www.simulide.com/p/downloads.html

Once downloaded there are more examples about Opamp circuits at 
SimulIDE_0.4.15-SR1_Win64\share\simulide\examples\OP_Amp

This repository starts at example no. 21 from the book.

21. Square Wave Generator - Kick Starter is needed because the 741 does not pick up 
noise from the surroundings like on a real bread board.
